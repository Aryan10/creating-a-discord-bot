Creating a bot in discord is stupid easy, first you need to go to [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click "New Application"
![Application Screen](http://www.zimagez.com/full/0a2a529af951d1ec817defaa1cf6b754283152f1243b382f6924c0fb25bf0a9d81967200da60e74758fa8f3a3aa2fa94818d41c39abe4454.php)
Now give your bot a name and a picture, a description isn't necessary.
